## Description: My proposal project is to create the all-popular tic-tac-toe game. For people to play on the computer when theyâ€™re bored with someone else or by themselves with AI.  homework. Option one is the original method of the game player vs player two going against other people however this is only in person in-person not online. The second game mode of the game was to allow the player, if no one else is there to play with them, the ability to play the game by themselves with an AI player. This allows the player to now just enjoy but challenge themselves to be better.
